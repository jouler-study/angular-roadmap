# Component Definitions

A class with the @Component() decorator that associates it with a companion template. Together, the component class and template define a view. A component is a special type of directive. The @Component() decorator extends the @Directive() decorator with template-oriented features.

An Angular component class is responsible for exposing data and handling most of the display and user-interaction logic of the view through data binding.
